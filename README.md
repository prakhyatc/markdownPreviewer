# Markdown Previewer

A simple Markdown previewer web application built using React and the Marked library.

## Description

This project is a Markdown previewer that allows users to input GitHub flavored markdown into a text editor and see the rendered HTML output in real-time. It includes the following features:

- Users can see a textarea element with the id "editor".
- Users can see an element with the id "preview".
- When users enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated in real-time to display the content of the textarea.
- Users can enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, and the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as they type.
- Upon loading, the default text in the #editor field contains valid markdown that represents various elements, including headings, links, inline code, code blocks, list items, blockquotes, images, and bolded text.
- The default markdown in the #editor field is rendered as HTML in the #preview element when the app first loads.
